# Yew Admin Dashboard

A lightweight boilerplate for Yew + Bootstrap that lets you build a dashboard UI without fighting through bloated, convoluted themes.

## :warning: Before You Start

This isn't a complete dashboard—it includes API references to another one of my projects. The goal is to show how you can build a fully responsive dashboard with Yew and Bootstrap, using minimal styling and zero extra JavaScript.

## How to Use

1. Copy the code.
2. Delete everything.
3. Put things back as you need them.

Simple, right?

## Why This Exists
- A refresher if UI isn’t your usual playground.
- You’d rather start from bare bones than untangle layers of unnecessary CSS, HTML, and JS.
